# Testcase Example:  '1'
#
# Given a positive integer n, return the number of all possible attendance
# records with length n, which will be regarded as rewardable. The answer may
# be very large, return it after mod 109 + 7.
#
# A student attendance record is a string that only contains the following
# three characters:
#
#
#
# 'A' : Absent.
# 'L' : Late.
# ‚Å†'P' : Present.
#
#
#
#
# A record is regarded as rewardable if it doesn't contain more than one 'A'
# (absent) or more than two continuous 'L' (late).
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: n = 2
# Output: 8
# Explanation:
# There are 8 records with length 2 will be regarded as rewardable:
# "PP" , "AP", "PA", "LP", "PL", "AL", "LA", "LL"
# Only "AA" won't be regarded as rewardable owing to more than one absent
# times.
#
#
#
# Note:
# The value of n won't exceed 100,000.
