# Testcase Example:  '[1,0,1,1,0,1]'
#
#
# Given a binary array, find the maximum number of consecutive 1s in this array
# if you can flip at most one 0.
#
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: [1,0,1,1,0]
# Output: 4
# Explanation: Flip the first zero will get the the maximum number of
# consecutive 1s.
# ‚Å†   After flipping, the maximum number of consecutive 1s is 4.
#
#
#
# Note:
#
# The input array will only contain 0 and 1.
# The length of input array is a positive integer and will not exceed 10,000
#
#
#
# Follow up:
# What if the input numbers come in one by one as an infinite stream? In other
# words, you can't store all numbers coming from the stream as it's too large
# to hold in memory. Could you solve it efficiently?
