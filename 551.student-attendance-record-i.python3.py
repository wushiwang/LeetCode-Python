#
# You are given a string representing an attendance record for a student. The
# record only contains the following three characters:
#
#
#
# 'A' : Absent.
# 'L' : Late.
# ‚Å†'P' : Present.
#
#
#
#
# A student could be rewarded if his attendance record doesn't contain more
# than one 'A' (absent) or more than two continuous 'L' (late).
#
# You need to return whether the student could be rewarded according to his
# attendance record.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: "PPALLP"
# Output: True
#
#
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input: "PPALLL"
# Output: False
