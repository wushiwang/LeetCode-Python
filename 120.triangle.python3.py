#
# Given a triangle, find the minimum path sum from top to bottom. Each step you
# may move to adjacent numbers on the row below.
#
# For example, given the following triangle
#
#
# [
# ⁠    [2],
# ⁠   [3,4],
# ⁠  [6,5,7],
# ⁠ [4,1,8,3]
# ]
#
#
# The minimum path sum from top to bottom is 11 (i.e., 2 + 3 + 5 + 1 = 11).
#
# Note:
#
# Bonus point if you are able to do this using only O(n) extra space, where n
# is the total number of rows in the triangle.
