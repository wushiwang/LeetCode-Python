# Testcase Example:  '[1,2,3,4]'
#
# Given aÂ linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head.
#
# Example:
#
#
# Given 1->2->3->4, you should return the list as 2->1->4->3.
#
# Note:
#
#
# Your algorithm should use only constant extra space.
# You may not modify the values in the list's nodes, only nodes itself may be
# changed.
#
#
#
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None
