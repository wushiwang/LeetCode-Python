# Testcase Example:  '["i", "love", "leetcode", "i", "love", "coding"]\n2'
#
# Given a non-empty list of words, return the k most frequent elements.
# Your answer should be sorted by frequency from highest to lowest. If two
# words have the same frequency, then the word with the lower alphabetical
# order comes first.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: ["i", "love", "leetcode", "i", "love", "coding"], k = 2
# Output: ["i", "love"]
# Explanation: "i" and "love" are the two most frequent words.
# ⁠   Note that "i" comes before "love" due to a lower alphabetical order.
#
#
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input: ["the", "day", "is", "sunny", "the", "the", "the", "sunny", "is",
# "is"], k = 4
# Output: ["the", "is", "sunny", "day"]
# Explanation: "the", "is", "sunny" and "day" are the four most frequent words,
# ⁠   with the number of occurrence being 4, 3, 2 and 1 respectively.
#
#
#
# Note:
#
# You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ number of unique elements.
# Input words contain only lowercase letters.
#
#
#
# Follow up:
#
# Try to solve it in O(n log k) time and O(n) extra space.
