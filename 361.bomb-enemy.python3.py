# Testcase Example:  '[["0","E","0","0"],["E","0","W","E"],["0","E","0","0"]]'
#
# Given a 2D grid, each cell is either a wall 'W', an enemy 'E' or empty '0'
# (the number zero), return the maximum enemies you can kill using one bomb.
# The bomb kills all the enemies in the same row and column from the planted
# point until it hits the wall since the wall is too strong to be destroyed.
# ‚Å†Note that you can only put the bomb at an empty cell.
#
# Example:
#
# For the given grid
#
# 0 E 0 0
# E 0 W E
# 0 E 0 0
#
# return 3. (Placing a bomb at (1,1) kills 3 enemies)
