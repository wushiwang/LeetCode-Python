#
# Think about Zuma Game. You have a row of balls on the table, colored red(R),
# yellow(Y), blue(B), green(G), and white(W). You also have several balls in
# your hand.
#
# Each time, you may choose a ball in your hand, and insert it into the row
# (including the leftmost place and rightmost place). Then, if there is a group
# of 3 or more balls in the same color touching, remove these balls. Keep doing
# this until no more balls can be removed.
#
# Find the minimal balls you have to insert to remove all the balls on the
# table. If you cannot remove all the balls, output -1.
#
#
# Examples:
# Input: "WRRBBW", "RB"
# Output: -1
# Explanation: WRRBBW -> WRR[R]BBW -> WBBW -> WBB[B]W -> WW
#
# Input: "WWRRBBWW", "WRBRW"
# Output: 2
# Explanation: WWRRBBWW -> WWRR[R]BBWW -> WWBBWW -> WWBB[B]WW -> WWWW -> empty
#
# Input:"G", "GGGGG"
# Output: 2
# Explanation: G -> G[G] -> GG[G] -> empty
#
# Input: "RBYYBBRRB", "YRBGB"
# Output: 3
# Explanation: RBYYBBRRB -> RBYY[Y]BBRRB -> RBBBRRB -> RRRB -> B -> B[B] ->
# BB[B] -> empty
#
#
#
# Note:
#
# You may assume that the initial row of balls on the table wonâ€™t have any 3 or
# more consecutive balls with the same color.
# The number of balls on the table won't exceed 20, and the string represents
# these balls is called "board" in the input.
# The number of balls in your hand won't exceed 5, and the string represents
# these balls is called "hand" in the input.
# Both input strings will be non-empty and only contain characters
# 'R','Y','B','G','W'.
